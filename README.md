# Image_Classification_App
This project is a Image Classification Android Application.
Technologies used: Java and XML.
Deep Learning model is made by using Convolutional Neural Network coded with python(inc Tensorflow,Keras,numpy,pandas,etc libs).
For converting the model for using it in Android system, TensorflowLite is used.
